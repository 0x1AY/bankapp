## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Data Loading Issues
**Problem**: Tests are failing because expected data is not being loaded or displayed correctly.

**Symptoms**:
- Account names like "El Ildaro" not found in DOM
- Transaction descriptions like "Salary deposit" not found
- Expected 4 accounts but found 5 elements
- Expected 5 transactions but found different count

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between test expectations and actual API data structure/response format.

### 2. Form Element Issues
**Problem**: Form elements (select dropdowns) are not being populated with expected options.

**Symptoms**:
- `cy.select()` failing to find options like "John Doe", "El Ildaro"
- Transfer form dropdowns empty or not populated
- Account selection in transactions page failing

**Root Cause**: Form population logic may not be working correctly or API data format mismatch.

### 3. UI Element Structure Issues
**Problem**: Expected UI elements are not present or have different structure.

**Symptoms**:
- "View Details" buttons not found in account cards
- "Transfer" buttons not found in account cards
- Error message containers (`.bg-red-50`) not found
- Transaction detail elements (h4, .font-semibold, .text-xs) not found

**Root Cause**: Component structure may have changed or elements are conditionally rendered.

### 4. Mobile Navigation Issues
**Problem**: Mobile navigation tests are failing due to CSS display properties.

**Symptoms**:
- Navigation elements hidden with `display: none`
- Mobile menu button not visible
- Navigation items not clickable in mobile view

**Root Cause**: Responsive design implementation may not be working correctly.

### 5. Search and Filter Issues
**Problem**: Search and filter functionality is not working as expected.

**Symptoms**:
- Search not filtering results correctly
- Filter dropdowns not working
- Results summary not displaying correctly

**Root Cause**: Search/filter logic may have bugs or data structure issues.

## Integration Test Issues
**Problem**: Integration test file is empty (0 tests)
**Impact**: No end-to-end workflow testing
**Action Required**: Implement integration tests for complete user journeys

## Screenshots Generated
- 43 screenshots captured for failed tests
- Screenshots saved in `cypress/screenshots/` directory
- Each failure has a corresponding screenshot for debugging

## Recommendations for Refactoring

### 1. Data Structure Alignment
- Review API response format and ensure it matches test expectations
- Update test fixtures to match actual API data structure
- Verify account and transaction data format consistency

### 2. Component Structure Review
- Check if "View Details" and "Transfer" buttons are properly implemented
- Verify error message containers and styling classes
- Ensure transaction detail elements are correctly structured

### 3. Form Implementation Fixes
- Debug account dropdown population logic
- Verify form validation error display
- Check select element option population

### 4. Responsive Design Issues
- Fix mobile navigation visibility issues
- Ensure proper CSS classes for responsive behavior
- Test mobile menu functionality

### 5. Search and Filter Logic
- Debug search functionality implementation
- Fix filter dropdown population
- Implement proper results summary display

### 6. Test Data Consistency
- Align test expectations with actual API data
- Update test selectors to match current DOM structure
- Verify element visibility and interaction states

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Review and fix data loading issues
2. **Short-term**: Fix form element population problems
3. **Medium-term**: Implement proper error handling and validation
4. **Long-term**: Improve responsive design and mobile functionality
